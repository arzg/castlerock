      <p class="title">Eugene von Guérard’s <br><em>Castle Rock, Cape Schanck</em></p>

      <h1 id="description"><a href="#description">Description of our podcast</a></h1>

      <p>Eugene Von Guérard’s <em>Castle Rock, Cape Schanck</em> is a painting
      of a large, coastal rock face covered in grass, with a small lighthouse
      visible on top. This rock face slopes from a steep peak down to sea level.
      It is at this height at which the ocean is lapping at the deep red rocks.
      Just at the edge of where the grass has stopped and the rock begins at the
      sea-level side of the rock face stands a man, holding a long stick and
      wearing a wide-brimmed hat. This podcast discusses the importance of this
      painting and why losing it would be devastating.</p>

      <h1 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

      <p>Hey guys, it’s us; the second Team of Yeats. So, I was wondering today;
      is Eugene von Guérard’s painting even relevant anymore? But then I went
      online and found that a few vexing foreigners™ were trying to obtain
      Eugene Von Guérard’s <em>Castle Rock, Cape Schanck</em>; a staple of
      Australian beach culture</p>

      <h1 id="audience"><a href="#audience">Audience</a></h1>

      <p>Eugene von Guérard’s work is held is storage at the art gallery of
      South Australia. The museum has kept it back because they don’t want
      anyone ruining it. But, in actuality we think it would be safer on an
      actual display. The main audience to the painting is the Australian
      students and teachers who vistit the gallery. The audience regards the
      painting as what the world should be and what it was like. During this
      time pollution has destroyed the environment so today it is regarded as a
      call for help. Eugene wanted to show the beauty of nature and what the
      world was like.</p>

      <h1 id="world"><a href="#world">World</a></h1>

      <p>Eugene Von Guérard finds Australia’s landscape very aesthetically
      pleasing because he appreciates the unique topography.He painted Australia
      because he came for the gold rush bu then noticed the Australian coastline
      whilst on a boat migrating to Australia. He was amazed by the natural
      beauty that was unlike his home. He produced his paintings during the
      romantic era which focused on emotions, the individual and an increased
      appreciation of nature. Despite painting in the Romantic period, he
      painted with a realistic style which focused on reproducing the subject
      matter as accurately as possible.</p>

      <h1 id="artist"><a href="#artist">Artist</a></h1>

      <p>Eugene von Guérard was born in Vienna on 7th of November 1811 with an
      Austrian and German heritage. At age 15, he travelled along with his
      father to Italy where he studied old masters and knowledge of painting
      from his father who worked at the court painter. He later moved to Rome
      where he studied at Giovanni Patista’s art school after his father passed
      away. He later migrated to Australia in 1852 for the gold rush.
      Unfortunately, he failed at finding any gold and decided to paint instead.
      Soon after, he travelled throughout Australia and New Zealand creating
      many of his paintings there including Mount New Zealand and Mount Abrupt.
      When Von Guérard was awarded.</p>

      <p>Eugene Von Guérard’s <em>Castle Rock, Cape Schanck</em> is a oil
      painting from 1865.  It’s a painting of a coastal rock face covered
      completely in grass. The ocean, the sun and the sky make up the
      background. While the main focal point in this work is a setting sun due
      to it’s bright colours as well as the leading lines going towards it. The
      lighthouse, unusual agaisnt the rest of the scenery and bright red agaisnt
      the blue sky, could also be considered as a secondary focal point. It’s
      painting expresses many different emotions while most are happy. It also
      represents joy and hope in this new land. The painting communicates a
      bright view of the future which is communicated through the man looking
      out to sea with the sun setting on the promising land. Pastels used for
      the sky and rich saturated colours, enhance this effect. Von Guérard saw
      beauty and promise in Australia and</p>

      <p>We shoudn’t sell Eugene von Guérards painting. In future use it may be
      used for seeing the pure landscape before development and before
      pollution. Its cultural significance: we can always look after the
      painting and who knows what other countries would do it they got hold of
      it. We can protect the histaory of Euegene von Guérard. All in all it
      supports the culture of our art. The revenue of the painting. It Could
      become a staple of an Australian Art Gallery. It increases money for the
      gallery and, via taxes, money for the government. For the Environment, Far
      into future, may be used as a benchmark for how beaches looked prior to
      climate change.</p>

      <h1 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>

      <p>Overall it is vital to keep this painting due to its extreme
      significance to Australian culture and therefore the loss of this painting
      would be devastating.</p>
